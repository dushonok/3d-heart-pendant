3d-heart-pendant
================

We want to create a 3D-printed pendant with the following shape:

![A heart drawn in gold ink](https://img0.etsystatic.com/021/0/8219627/il_340x270.561093744_hu40.jpg)

In order to do this, the first step is to create a 3D file describing that shape. Here is what we got so far:

![A half-finished heart](heart-pendant.stl)

Like [all our 3D projects](http://ourlifein3d.blogspot.ca/2011/12/houdini-and-3ds-max.html), we are modelling using Houdini.
