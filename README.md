3d-heart-pendant
================

We want to create a 3D-printed pendant with the following shape:

![A heart drawn in gold ink](https://img0.etsystatic.com/021/0/8219627/il_340x270.561093744_hu40.jpg)

In order to do this, the first step is to create a 3D file describing that shape. Like [all our 3D projects](http://ourlifein3d.blogspot.ca/2011/12/houdini-and-3ds-max.html), we are modelling using [Houdini](http://www.sidefx.com/).

Here is our result:

![3D shape of a heart similar to the drawing](3d-heart-pendant.png)

Here is a [3D view](heart-pendant.stl), and here is the [Shapeways item](https://www.shapeways.com/model/2623223/?li=aeTabs). It's not for sale because we are using a non-commercial Houdini license, but you can download the model and re-upload it in order to print your own.
